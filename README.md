# Deep-Learning-Assignments
This repo has my solutions for some of the assignments in a M.Sc. deep learning class at the Open University. 
The contents of the assignments is:
- **Ex1 & Ex2**: Implementing core features from PyTorch's abilities like AuroGrad, broadcasting mechanisms and random sampling


- **Ex3**: Building and training deep models for tabular data. Implementing a custom DataLoader.


- **Ex4**: Implementing a convolutional layer. Deriving the backprop pass through a convolutional layer.
           Transfer learning with the ResNet-18 module to classify ImageNet. Defining a custom ResNet and comparing the results.


- **Ex5**: An _Inverser Autoencoder_, a special kind of an autoencoder that seeks to minimize the loss between each (corresponding) pair of the encoder and the decoder.   
        A thorough discussion of the results and using the model to learn efficient representations of MNIST.   
        A fully custom, implemented from scratch, _Textual Autoencoder_. The autoencoder is trained on the IMDb dataset and is trained to clean text.    
        The "cleaning" process is the un-redacting of certain words that were omitted from the text.   
        A discussion of these results as well.
